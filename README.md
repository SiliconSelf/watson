# `watson`

Search for accounts across social media platforms by username. This is dramatically faster than the inspiring project [Sherlock](https://github.com/sherlock-project/sherlock) because it uses tokio to search in parallel.

## Why Not Use Sherlock?

I made this program because I got sick of how slow Sherlock is when I was searching for usernames that weren't already squatted on a site I use.
